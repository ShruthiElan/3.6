1. Number of data nodes = H/d
d- DISK SPACE=7TB
h- disk space=600TB 
n=600/7
n= 86 data nodes.

2.
Yes 
let us consider the block size to be 100 MB .5 blocks is to be replicated 3 times.
We have 5 blocks 1,2,3,4,5 for a file, a client, a namenode and a datanode. The client will take Block 1 to store in this block and the replicated copies.
Once client is aware about the datanode information, it will directly reach out to datanode and start copying Block 1
which will be replicated other 2 datanodes. Once the block is copied and replicated to the datanodes, client will get the confirmation about the Block 1 storage
and then the same process is continued for Block 2.
So, during this process if 1st block of 100 MB is written to HDFS and the next block has been started by the client to
store then 1st block will be visible to readers. Only the current block being written will not be visible by the readers.
